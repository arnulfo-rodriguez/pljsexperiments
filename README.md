# JsParser


An experimental JavaScript parser implemented using Prolog DCGs (still pretty incomplete) .  

The goal of this project is to implement a reasonably complete JavaScript parser according to the Ecma-262 specification.


## Running tests

To run the parser tests:

```
swipl -s tests.pl -t run_tests
```
